For our project, Group 03 plans to build a regex-powered text search tool that makes it easier to find and extract patterns from large text files or any text the user provides. Our MVP will keep things simple but useful by focusing on three main features: (1) a basic interface, either command-line or a simple GUI, where users can enter text and regex patterns, (2) reliable pattern matching using Python’s built-in re module with options like case sensitivity, whole word search, and groups, and (3) clear results that highlight the matches and show their line numbers or positions. With these features, our tool can already be applied to tasks like searching logs, checking data formats, or filtering content. This gives us a solid foundation, while leaving room to add more advanced features later,
