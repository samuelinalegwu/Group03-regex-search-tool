# Group 03 - Regex-Powered Text Search Tool

This project is a desktop application that allows users to run **regex-powered searches** across single files or entire folders with a **modern Tkinter GUI**. It supports multiple file types (TXT, CSV, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.), highlights matches, and allows exporting results.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Single File Search**: Open a file, run regex, and view highlighted matches.  
- **Folder Search**: Run regex across all files in a folder, view results in a table, and preview context.  
- **Regex Options**: Supports `IGNORECASE`, `MULTILINE`, `DOTALL`.  
- **Export**: Save matches to CSV or TXT.  
- **Saved Queries**: Store and reload frequently used regex patterns.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/samuelinalegwu/Group03-regex-search-tool.git>
cd Group03-regex-search-tool
```


### 2. Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

This project uses pipenv to manage dependencies. The Pipfile.lock guarantees that you will have the exact same package versions as the developers.

Run the following command to create a virtual environment and install all necessary packages:


``` bash
# Installs both production and development packages
pipenv install --dev
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
To run the application or tests, you must first activate the virtual environment:

``` bash
pipenv shell
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöÄ How to Run

### Run the Application
Once the virtual environment is activated, run the main application file:

``` bash
python src/app.py
```

### Run Tests
To ensure everything is set up correctly, you can run the test suite using pytest:


``` bash
pytest
```

You should see all tests pass successfully.
